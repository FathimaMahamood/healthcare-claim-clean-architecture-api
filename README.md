# Healthcare Claim Processing & AI Risk Analysis Platform

## Overview

Enterprise backend healthcare platform built using Clean Architecture principles.

The system processes healthcare claim submissions, performs validation, and integrates with an AI-based risk analysis microservice.

The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and interview showcase ready.

---

## Architecture

The project follows modular Clean Architecture design.

### Backend Design Principles

- Modular monolith backend architecture
- REST API principles
- Authentication and authorization module
- Claim processing workflow
- Message queue based async processing (planned)
- Python AI risk analyzer integration

### Technology Stack

- ASP.NET Core Backend
- Clean Architecture Pattern
- Dependency Injection
- Async Processing Workflow
- Domain Driven Separation (conceptual level)

---

## Features

### Security

- JWT Authentication
- Role-based authorization (Provider, InsuranceAdmin)

### Healthcare Processing

- Claim submission APIs
- Claim validation workflow
- Risk scoring analysis integration

### System Design Components

- Middleware logging pipeline
- Queue-based processing architecture
- External AI service communication

---

## Future Enhancements

- Kubernetes container orchestration
- Advanced NLP-based claim risk analysis
- Distributed processing pipeline
- Caching optimization strategies
- Monitoring and telemetry integration

---

## Design Philosophy

The system is built focusing on modular monolith backend architecture with the capability to evolve into microservices if required.

The primary goal is to demonstrate strong backend engineering, architecture understanding, and AI integration awareness.
